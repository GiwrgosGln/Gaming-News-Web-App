# Gaming-News-Web-App
This web application was built in collaboration with another student from the university using various programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap5, MySQL, and PHP. The goal of the project was to create a user-friendly interface that would enable the users to access recent posts, read information, login, and sign up.

We also added an admin panel to the web application that allowed the administrator to perform various administrative tasks such as adding posts, users, and managing the website. This panel is designed to make website management easier and more efficient.

As part of this university project, we plan to add a review page and an e-shop that will feature gaming stuff in the future.
